# Why I Write

I tend to think a lot but articulate very little.

Writing forces me to slow down and notice what I actually believe,
instead of what I vaguely feel.

This space exists to:
- clarify my thinking
- track my growth
- make peace with uncertainty

There is no audience in mind.
If this helps someone else, that is incidental.
